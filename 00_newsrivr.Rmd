### Notebook 00: retrieving news with {newsrivr}
**Feedback** should be send to `goran.milovanovic@datakolektiv.com`. 
These notebooks accompany the MilanoR talk 2019/06/25.  


***

### 0. Install newsrivr

Install the development version of [newsrivr](https://github.com/datakolektiv/newsrivr) from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datakolektiv/newsrivr")
```


### 1. Setup

**Note.** The following chunk loads packages and defines the project directory tree.

```{r echo = T}
## - libraries
library(newsrivr)

## - directories
dataDir <- 'data/'
```

### 2. Store newsrivr credentials
To access the Newsriver API, you must register for an API key at [newsriver.io](https://newsriver.io/). It is common practice to store API keys in your `.Renviron` file so they are available each time R is loaded. The newsrivr `store_creds()` function invokes this behaviour and prompts you for your API key (and user agent) and stores them in your `.Renviron` file in your home directory.

If you do not want to alter your `.Renviron` file, you can use the newsrivr `store_creds_temp()` function to temporarily store your credentials for that session.

```{r echo = T}
# Store credentials in the .Renviron file located in the home dir
# Provide a sensible user agent (e.g., contact email address)
store_creds()
```


### Retrieve news, clean news, and then write to disk

To retrieve news from the Newsriver API, use the newsrivr `get_news()` function. Currently, `get_news()` takes two arguments, `search_term_higher` and `search_term_lower`, which are keywords that are matched against the text and title of news articles (one being the capitalised version of the other). Currently, `get_news()` defaults to search for news articles from the past month. In the next iteration of the package, users will be able to search for articles across a range of search parameters and retrieve articles from the past year.

Once news articles have been retrieved, they can be passed into the newsrivr `clean_news()` function which provides a set of sensible defaults and options. These defaults include removing unwanted metadata, filtering "junk" articles, removing duplicates, converting date strings to class "Date", transforming characters to lower case, and more!

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
# - write function that retrievs and cleans news and then saves
# - to disk
save_news <- function(query){
  news <- get_news(query = query)
  news <- clean_news(news) 
  saveRDS(news, paste0(dataDir, tolower(query), ".rds"))
}
 
# - Iterate save_news() over list of companies
save_news("Google")
save_news("Facebook")
save_news("Microsoft")
save_news("Twitter")
save_news("Apple")
```
